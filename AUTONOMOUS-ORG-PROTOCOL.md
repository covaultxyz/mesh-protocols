# Autonomous Organization Protocol v1.0

*Last updated: 2026-01-31*
*Maintainers: Protocol Office*

---

## Purpose

Defines how Covault's virtual teams evolve from well-designed workbenches into autonomous execution units capable of completing work with minimal human intervention.

---

## Evolution Path

```
STAGE 1: WORKBENCH
    │   (Current state for most teams)
    │   - Personas defined in Notion
    │   - Roles and skills documented
    │   - No execution capability
    │
    ▼
STAGE 2: WORKFLOW-ENABLED
    │   - Execution workflows defined
    │   - Handoff patterns established
    │   - Can execute with human oversight
    │
    ▼
STAGE 3: SEMI-AUTONOMOUS
    │   - Night Shift capable
    │   - Pre-approved action boundaries
    │   - Executes work plans independently
    │   - Human review on completion
    │
    ▼
STAGE 4: FULLY AUTONOMOUS
        - Self-assigns from queue
        - Self-monitors quality
        - Human intervention only for exceptions
        - Continuous improvement loop
```

## Autonomous Teams Roadmap

### Priority 1: Automation Team
**Status:** Workbench (needs activation)
**Purpose:** Funnel/campaign execution
**Activation tasks:**
- [ ] Define campaign execution workflow
- [ ] Map persona handoffs
- [ ] Create first work plan
- [ ] Test run with human oversight
- [ ] Graduate to Night Shift capable

### Priority 2: Website Building Team
**Status:** Not yet formed
**Purpose:** Near-autonomous website/landing page creation
**Activation tasks:**
- [ ] Define team personas
- [ ] Design build workflow
- [ ] Integrate with design tools
- [ ] Create template library
- [ ] Test build cycle

### Priority 3: BD Execution Team
**Status:** Partial (BD Terminal exists)
**Purpose:** Business development surface operations
**Activation tasks:**
- [ ] Connect to BD Terminal
- [ ] Define outreach workflows
- [ ] Integrate with pipeline DB
- [ ] Permission enforcement active
- [ ] Test autonomous outreach

### Priority 4: Coherence Screening Team
**Status:** Not yet formed
**Purpose:** Data room screening pre-investor roadshow
**Activation tasks:**
- [ ] Define screening criteria
- [ ] Create coherence checklist
- [ ] Build review workflow
- [ ] Integrate with document stores
- [ ] Test screening run

## Governance

### Human Touchpoints
Even fully autonomous teams require human approval for:
- External communications (email, social, investor contact)
- Financial transactions
- Legal document modifications
- Production deployments
- New team member additions

### Audit Trail
All autonomous actions logged to:
- Virtual Team Activity Log (Notion)
- Mesh Work Log (project-level)
- GitHub (code/doc changes)

### Quality Assurance
- Team leader reviews all output before delivery
- Protocol Office audits execution patterns
- Cassian (Orchestrator) monitors cross-team coherence

## Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Work plans executed autonomously | Track count |
| Human intervention rate | < 20% of steps |
| Completion rate (no blockers) | > 80% |
| Time to completion vs estimate | ±20% |

## Version History

| Version | Date | Changes |
|---------|------|---------|
| 1.0 | 2026-01-31 | Initial protocol |

*The goal: An organization that executes while you sleep and improves while you're awake.*
