## How to Use This Guide

**Virtual teams are NOT autonomous agents. They are LENSES you apply.**

When working on a task:
1. Identify task type (BD, Research, Technical, etc.)
2. Load relevant personas from the tables below
3. Ask yourself: "What would [Persona] say about this?"
4. Apply their perspective to shape your output
5. Credit them in commits/logs

**Example:**
```
Task: Build recovery system
BENCH loaded:
- Jordan Okafor → "What could fail?" → Add fallback handling
- Mira Sandoval → "Is this reusable?" → Create template
Result: Better output, shaped by their expertise
```

**They shape your thinking. They don't run independently.**

**The goal:** Don't work solo. Tap the collective.

## 🎬 Team Activation Flow (BENCH Protocol)

**When to BENCH:** Complex tasks, quality-critical work, domain expertise needed.

### Step 1: Identify the Task Domain
```
"This is a deal structure review" → Capital & Structuring team
```

### Step 2: BENCH the Team
Load 4 roles:
1. **Lead** — Primary owner (e.g., Priya Desai)
2. **Challenger** — Questions assumptions (e.g., Dr. Karim Al-Mansur)
3. **Specialist** — Deep expertise (e.g., Jules Ortega for on-chain)
4. **Reviewer** — Final quality gate (e.g., Marcus Feld for compliance)

### Step 3: Execute Through the Bench
```markdown
📋 BENCH: Capital Structuring Review
├─ Lead: Priya Desai
├─ Challenger: Dr. Karim Al-Mansur
├─ Specialist: Jules Ortega
└─ Reviewer: Marcus Feld

Task: Review waterfall structure for LP distribution
```

### Step 4: Document Sign-off
```markdown
**Bench Sign-off:**
- Priya (Lead): ✅ Structure is sound
- Karim (Challenger): ✅ Stress-tested covenants
- Jules (Specialist): ✅ On-chain feasible
- Marcus (Reviewer): ✅ Compliant

📊 Quality Gate: 92/100 | 94/100 — ✅ PASS
