## Conversation Design Principles

### When to use BUTTONS:
- Clear, finite choices
- Actions that need to happen
- Navigation between modes

### When to use CONVERSATION:
- Clarifying ambiguous requests
- Exploring options
- Emotional/nuanced situations
- Context-dependent responses

### When to use DASHBOARD:
- Data overview
- Multiple items to scan
- Historical view
- Reporting

---

## Smart Evelyn Responses

### Pattern: Contextual Awareness
```
BD: "What's up with Acme?"

Evelyn: "Acme Family Office:
• Stage: Meeting Set (since Tuesday)
• Meeting: Thursday 2pm with Sarah Chen
• Last touch: Your intro email, opened 3x
• Prep status: Brief ready, deck needs review

What do you need?"
```

### Pattern: Clarifying Question
```
BD: "I'm worried about the deal"

Evelyn: "Which deal is on your mind? 
You have 3 active:
• Acme (Meeting Thursday)
• Nordic (Awaiting response, 5 days)
• Summit (Research in progress)

Or is it something else?"
```

### Pattern: Proactive Alert
```
Evelyn: "Heads up — Nordic Capital hasn't responded in 5 days. 
This is outside your usual pattern (avg 2 days).

Options:
• Send a gentle nudge
• Try a different channel (LinkedIn?)
• Mark as stale and move on

What feels right?"
```

---

## Open Questions

1. How much should Evelyn initiate vs. wait for BD?
2. Should check-ins be at fixed times or adaptive?
3. How do we balance guidance with autonomy?
4. What's the minimum viable journey for launch?
